Dev-Notes
=========

I’ve left behind some notes on the making of GDScript language definition and the Godot theme for Highlight. Hopefully, this notes might be useful to:

-   future maintainers of this project,
-   anyone wishing to create a GDScript lang definition for other syntax highlighting tools,
-   anyone wishing to port the Godot theme to other tools (highlighters or code editors).
